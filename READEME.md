This is a simple c sharp example that demonstrates how to launch an external process, and wait for the process to become initialized.
The initialization is confirmed when the process returns a specific string in the output such as "ready"

The obvious usecase for this is if you have a pre-comiled api of some sort that you need to launch and/or control as part of your solution.
This becomes more relevant if you have multiple apis, or need to run multiple instances of the api on different ports or with different command line arguments.

This example can be extended to allow for cycling and allowing for a maximum number of instances. Port range restrictions etc.
